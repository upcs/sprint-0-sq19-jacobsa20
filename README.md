This is my README file, I can put any text into it, so here goes:



[sirens]
Yes.
Hello, baby.
Come to Papa. Come on.
Ah ha ha ha!
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come to Papa.
I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.
You stupid motherfuckers!
No! No!
Turn the fuckin' truck around!
[elevator bell dings]
The fire has been called off, my friend.
No-one is coming to help you.
You might as well come out
and join the others.
I promise I won't hurt you.
[whirring]
[whirring slows]
Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.
You won't hurt me.
Yeah? Why not?
Because you're a policeman.
There are rules for policemen.
Yeah, that's what my captain
keeps telling me.
Bet your ass I wish to proceed.
[whirring]

"Now I have a machine gun."
"Ho... ho... ho."


[Ellis] What do you think?
Something's wrong.
Cops?
- John.
- John?
[Ellis] He can fuck
this whole thing up.
What does he think he's doing?
His job.
Bullshit.
His job's 3,000 miles away.
Without him, we still have
a chance to get out of here.

[woman] It's the same address
as that fire signal.
[2nd woman] I'll handle it.
Attention, whoever you are,...
..this channel is reserved
for emergency calls only.
(McClane)No fucking shit, lady!
Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?
No-one kills him but me.
They have already killed one hostage.
They are fortifying their positions
while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!
Sir, I've already told you.
This is a reserved channel.
If this is an emergency call,
dial 911 on your telephone.
Otherwise, I'll report this
as an FCC violation.
Fine! Report me!
Come the fuck down here and arrest me!
Just send the police now!
[gunshots on radio]
See if a black and white can drive by.
[humming] # Let It Snow #
Thought you guys just ate doughnuts.
- They're for my wife.
- Yeah.
- She's pregnant.
- Yeah.
Bag it.
Big time.
Thanks.
[clanging]
"Come out to the coast!"
"We'll get together,
have a few laughs."
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.
[TV] ..Notre Dame on top of USC.
Aw, shit!
I got 50 bucks bet on them assholes.
Come on, come on,
where's the fucking cavalry?
[speaking German]
[TV] ..was good for 52 yards.
Mind if I look around?
Help yourself.
[TV] 27 seconds left in this first period.
Seven to nothing, Notre Dame.
The Irish driving 74 yards
in eight plays...
I'll put this fuckin'...
Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!
Don't shoot!
- Put the gun down!
- OK! Don't shoot!
Drop that fuckin' gun!
Marco, down!
[shouting in Italian]
Ah, to hell with this!
[shouting]
You are done!
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?
Next time you have a chance
to kill someone,...
..don't hesitate.
Thanks for the advice.
- Sorry to waste your time.
- No problem at all.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.
Welcome to the party, pal!
They're turning my car
into Swiss cheese!
I need backup assistance now!
Now, goddamn it! Now!
Never thought
I'd love to hear that sound.
[McClane]
They have a freakin' arsenal here.
We must have the detonators.
They got missiles, automatic weapons,...
..and enough plastic explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Call me...
..Roy.
Listen up, Roy,
if you think of anything else...
..don't be shy, OK?
In the meantime, find a safe place
and let us do our job.
They're all yours, Al.

'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house
not a creature was stirring, except
the four assholes
coming in the rear in standard
two-by-two cover formation.

Oh, shit.
Tell her that, um
that she's the best thing
that ever happened to a bum like me.
She's heard me say "I love you"
a thousand times.
She never heard me say I'm sorry.
After all your posturing,
all your little speeches,
you're nothing but a common thief.
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs McClane.
And since I'm moving up
to kidnapping,
you should be more polite.
You motherfucker,
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,
and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!
I don't like this, Sarge.
Yee-hah!
Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?
I was in Junior High, dickhead.
